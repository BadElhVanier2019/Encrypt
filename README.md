My name is Elham and I am a 16 year old student in grade 11. I am an  aspiring software developer/ software engineer.
I will be pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science in univeristy. I personally do not care which university 
I attend, but if I have the ability to, I would attend UofT. In 10 years I see myself working at a company or creating
my own apps and publishing them. My favourite part of computer science is solving problems and being able to create something
new and cool with my knowledge.
